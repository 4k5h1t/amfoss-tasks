## My Experience with the tasks.
I thoroughly enjoyed my experience working on these tasks and it cemented my desire to join amFOSS right from the get-go by making me take the jump on switching to Linux and expand my horizons with tasks like GitHub and Git. The tasks really got me out of my comfort zone and into the expansive world of open-source and programming, and it's clear that these tasks were made to find the hardest working people. The variety and depth of the tasks were awesome and inspired me to redefine (in my mind) the extent to which I can use open-source, programming and CS in general to help the public.

## My Experience with the process as a whole.
To condense it down, it was fun!! Every concept, joke and pseudo-easter egg references (like the pokemon-gyms, Rich Tony Poor Spidey, Infinity Stones, Geddit(that was a weird pun)) made me feel like the club comprised of people similar to me, 'cause those were stuff I would've put in the tasks, just to make it more enjoyable. My (psyduck)gym-trainer, Yash was extremely helpful and answered my doubts in a very timely manner, which I appreciated a lot because I had gotten my email late and was a bit stressed. Overall it was a very informative and fun experience and I am looking forward to meeting the club irl.

## Thanks For the Experience!!!
