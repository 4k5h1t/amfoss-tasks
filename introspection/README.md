# Introspection
## Why must we choose you?
>###   A few reasons why you must choose me to join the amFOSS club are :-
>>####     1. I am very passionate about all things related to coding and computers, and there is nothing i'd rather do than code and find solutions to problems.
>>####     2. Open-Source projects have always been a point of interest for me, I have tried to take some steps and contribute in the past but was overwhelmed by it's vastness and had little to no guidance, Google was my only friend in this matter :) (and I didn't really have time because this was during my 10th)
>>####     3. I am well acquainted with coding culture and would like to think of myself as a helpful individual.
## What is your plan for the next 6 months?
>###   I am quite dead-set on working at Google so, I would like to take part in GSoC within the next 6 months if that is possible.
## How would you contribute back to the club? 
>###   As I said, I would like to think I am a helpful person and am dead-set on Google, so I would do my best in contributing back to the club by helping anyone I can to understand and navigate the open-source world, as this club (I hope) would've done for me.
>###   Also I would do everything within and beyond my abilities to win laurels for our school and club in international (GSoC) and national competitions(coding competitions, CTFs and Hackathons).
## Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
>###   Well I'm not really done with the whole process but up until now, I really liked the variety of tasks that were set and everything was compiled and communicated pretty nicely. I had a small problem with receiving my mail for the discord invite but other than that everything went smoothly.
