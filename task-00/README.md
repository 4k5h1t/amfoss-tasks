# Task-00: Installing Ubuntu 20.04
## My Experience:
### I have been meaning to start using Linux for a while now, and I have finally done it, I chose the Ubuntu 20.04 distro and the installation and setting up process went something like this...:-
>>1. Downloaded Ubuntu 20.04 LTS from the site, as well as balena.io to burn the iso (format that the Ubuntu software is in, so that it can be burned to a disc or USB drive)
>>2. Partitioned my system, allocating 100 GB for the Linux distro.
>>3. Burned the distro into my USB drive, creating what is called a "live-usb" 
After this, it got a bit dicey....
>>4. Opened up the GRUB window of my system to boot using the live usb
>>>Went to the BIOS screen by mistake a few times, The option to boot using the live usb didn't show up a few times (fixed it by shutting down instead of restarting),etc.
>>> By the way, new versions of windows and intel does not allow to run linux like this without explicit permission, so you'll have to disable intel RST, and decrypt Windows BitLocker.
>>> This step was the hardest to get past.
>>5. Once that was done, it was smooth sailing, just create an account and so on, just follow the prompts.
###Also this Background and terminal interface and system is super cool.
