# How I approached the fourth task "Debugging Derbies"
> First I compiled it with no changes to catch all syntax errors, like missing semicolons, missing parenthese, and misspelled function names
> Then, I ran the program to get an idea of what was being done exactly. (or the intent of the program at least)
> Once I understood the layout, I put in some options (add and starter, just because they came up first), immediately noticed that the question printed shows '*', instead of '+'
>> To rectify this I went into the code and tried to figure out what all the functions were named (Thank you for the comments, otherwise it looked like a lot of gibberish)
>>> Found the part of the code that handles the calculations and changed all of them, including the question text cause they were all wrong.

>> PS. before that I noticed that the labels for the Start and Stop button were switched, changed that. 

>> Ran it again, noticed the correct answer count.
>>> Found that part in the code, changed the decrement operator to increment, noticed the wrong conter was also weird so fixed that too.

>> Ran it again, seemed to be working fine.

> Checked the interval option with multiple types of test cases (both negatives, one positive one negative, float values etc.)
>> Checked the code part of the intervals, just in case, checked the interval values, for some reason the intermediate part starts from 3, but I assumed it was a choice.

> Noticed that if you give an empty textbox as an answer, the terminal goes crazy, didn't try to make an exception handler for that. (Because this labelling and button stuff is new to me, also if it works, don't touch it! XD)

> Ran it a few more times just to check all of the options and the calculations of seconds, correct and wrong answers, etc.

> Gave it one last look through, spotted a typo in a label (unimportant)

## Probably the most fun i've had with any of the tasks and deefinitely the most fun i've had debugging someone else's code
## Overall it was an awesome task!!
