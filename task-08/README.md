# Sir Perceval's Quest:
 
 This was an awesome task, and very confusing to get through for someone new to tools like this and the Github API etc. but I loved figuring it out and it was one of the tasks wgere Google could only help you if you knew what you were doing and were awfully specific.
 So, it helped me improve my googling skills and also my patience above all else cause the number of silly mistakes I made along the way is really high, but it was worth it for the result.
